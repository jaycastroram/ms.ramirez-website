          I believe that every student has inherent worth, unique potential, and
          the capacity for growth. Rooted in humanistic theory, my counseling
          approach is centered on empathy, authenticity, and unconditional
          positive regard. I view each student through a holistic
          lens‚Äîrecognizing the connection between their emotional, social,
          academic, and cultural experiences.
